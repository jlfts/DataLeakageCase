# DataLeakageCase
A walkthrough of NIST's Data Leakage Case.

If you haven't already, read up on the scenario overview https://cfreds-archive.nist.gov/data_leakage_case/data-leakage-case.html

In my last semester of school, I had a forensics class that used this resource. I found it fascinating, and the forensic process equally as fascinating.
Due to time constraints, however, my team didn't format the assignment as an official report. 
I'm using this repository to answer some of the questions in the exercise and provide a professional report.

If you're a student working on this exercise, I implore you to keep trying it on your own. For me, research was just as important as the actual forensic process.

I'm using the following tools to accomplish this project:
  - Kali Linux
  - The handbook provided by https://linuxleo.com/

Other importan Linux commands 
  - plocate
