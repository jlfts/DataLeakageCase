# DataLeakageCase
A walkthrough of NIST's Data Leakage Case.

If you haven't already, read up on the scenario overview https://cfreds-archive.nist.gov/data_leakage_case/data-leakage-case.html

In my last semester of school, I had a forensics class that used this resource. I found it fascinating, and the forensic process equally as fascinating.
Due to time constraints, however, my team didn't format the assignment as an official report. 
I'm using this repository to go through the concepts present in the exercise. I don't intend to directly answer many questions. Instead, I want to present my thought process to help future students work through similar exercises.

I'm using the following tools to accomplish this project:
  - Kali Linux
  - The handbook provided by https://linuxleo.com/
  - The Sleuthkit https://www.kali.org/tools/sleuthkit/

Any walkthroughs I provide will have a more comprehensive list of tools.
